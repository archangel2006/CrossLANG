CrossLang

CrossLang is a curated collection of small, educational projects implemented in both Python and C++. The primary goal is to demonstrate object-oriented programming, problem-solving skills, and cross-language proficiency by building the same project in two languages.

Overview

This repository allows developers and learners to:

Explore OOP concepts (classes, encapsulation, methods, constructors) in Python and C++.

Compare high-level Python implementations with low-level C++ implementations.

Build interactive mini-projects that reinforce programming fundamentals.

Transition easily from console-based applications to GUI-based applications.

Learning Objectives

Master C++ syntax including classes, constructors, methods, and access specifiers.

Reinforce Python fundamentals while applying them in C++.

Gain experience with console-based and GUI-based applications.

Understand differences in memory management, data types, and program structure between Python and C++.



Usage

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/CrossLang.git


Navigate to a project folder and run the Python implementation:

python3 pet.py


Compile and run the C++ version:

g++ pet.cpp -o pet -std=c++11
./pet


Note: Some C++ projects may require additional libraries (e.g., SFML for GUI).

Future Plans

Complete remaining projects in both Python and C++.

Implement GUI versions using SFML or Qt.

Add detailed documentation and learning notes for each project.
